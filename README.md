# Ap0110_Simulator

A simple simulation that encompasses the real-world issue of space debris that constantly orbits the Earth. Organizations such as NASA and the U.s Department of Defense keep track in where the different debris lies which could be satelites, small microchip, to even a small rocket booste. Debris that orbits at a height of almost 375 miles won't reenter the Earth's atmosphere for several years.

Ap0110_Simulator will return as a featured game on Project Aero_Astro
